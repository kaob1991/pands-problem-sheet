Work to be done: 

Cross ref python read me files to ensure doc is correct
figure out why links are not coming out correctly on github but are fine on vsc



Brief's: 

Week 2: bmi.py

Week 4: collatz.py
  Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
  At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
  Have the program end if the current value is one.

Week 6: squareroot.py
  Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
  You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
  I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
  This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would use one of the above methods).
  I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots.

Week 8: plottask.py
  Write a program called plottask.py that displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.
  Some marks will be given for making the plot look nice.
