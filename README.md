# pands-problem-sheet

Work to be done: 

ES.PY and ES2.PY need annotations (pick one method if I can figure out the rest of the code to pick only the e's out of es.py)
all .py programs need to be neatened up and references tidied up 

weekday.py needs python docs as reference regarding weekday module 

write up readme file and research online correct way to do that


Brief's: 

Week 2: bmi.py
  Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). 
  The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms.
  The output  is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.

Week 3: secondstring.py
  Write a program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order. 

Week 4: collatz.py
  Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
  At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
  Have the program end if the current value is one.

Week 5: weekday.py
  Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. Vary the output depending on whether it is a weekday or weekend.

Week 6: squareroot.py
  Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
  You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
  I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
  This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would use one of the above methods).
  I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots.

Week 7: es.py
  Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.
  The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line.

Week 8: plottask.py
  Write a program called plottask.py that displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.
  Some marks will be given for making the plot look nice.
