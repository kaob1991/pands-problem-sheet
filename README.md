# pands-problem-sheet

Work to be done: 

ES.PY and ES2.PY need annotations (pick one method if I can figure out the rest of the code to pick only the e's out of es.py)
all .py programs need to be neatened up and references tidied up 

weekday.py needs python docs as reference regarding weekday module 

write up readme file and research online correct way to do that
