import sys # module to manipulate the Python runtime environment

k = 0 # base for appending the number of e's in file
filename = sys.argv [1] # returns a list of command line arguments passed to a Python script

with open (filename, "r") as f: # opens the mobydick.txt file
    for line in f: # takes each line in mobydick file
        words = line.split() # takes each word by splitting the line
        for i in words: # seperates the words out
            for letter in i:
                if letter == "e": # asks if the letter is "e"
                    k = k + 1 # if it is, appends to k and increases the value by 1
print (k) # prints the result
