input_string = input("Please enter a sentence: ") # asks user to input a sentence 

output_backwards = input_string[::-1]
# this reverses the string starting at position 0 and reversing one character each time


every_2nd_letter = output_backwards[::2]
# this outputs the reversed sentence by telling Python to start at pos 0 and return every other character 


print(every_2nd_letter) # prints result
